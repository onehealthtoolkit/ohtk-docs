Rather than relying on traditional surveillance methods using trained epidemiologists in the field, the Toolkit Software can be used by non-technical users for a variety of public health concerns. The Toolkit provides a Surveillance Management System ( ohtk-ms ) for local authorities and a Reporter App ( ohtk-mobile ) for trained reporters or volunteers. Local Governments or similar local authorities use OHTK-MS and OHTK-Mobile together to create a complete surveillance system used for managing and responding to emerging One Health threats. The API ( ohtk-api ) connects the mobile app and the management system together. The One Health Surveillance Management System OHTK-MS is deployed by local authorities in order to track incoming reports from their community volunteers, manage high risk cases, and respond to potential outbreaks.
