Using OHTK-Mobile Inviting Users Once the One Health Surveillance Management System is configured correctly, the local authority can begin recruiting and training volunteers for the Reporter App. The authority must create unique Invitation Codes to distribute to volunteers during training meetings, so that the volunteers\u2019 reports are submitted to the correct system. The Reporter App can be downloaded from either the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, and volunteers must simply enter their unique Invitation Code to login to enable them as qualified reporters. Their reports will be automatically directed to the correct country and region according to the Authority\u2019s configuration of OHTK-MS. Once downloaded and the Invitation Code is applied, the Reporter App can be used by volunteers to collect a variety of One Health reports and submit them to OHTK-MS for the local authority to review and escalate to a case for investigation if required. Notifications and Alerts Important notifications are delivered via the Reporter App, such as quarantine instructions for sick animals, follow-up questionnaires for volunteers involved in cases or outbreaks, and reminders for volunteer trainings. The Reports are automatically submitted to OHTK-MS for analysis and review by local authorities, but if they match predefined Case Definitions then they will be automatically escalated to Cases. For example, if after training the volunteer notices that 15 of their pigs are experiencing illness, they would use the Reporter App to create a new Report with observation notes such as photos of the symptomatic pigs, observable symptoms, length of illness, and number of sick animals.

Setting up OHTK-MS What you'll need Node.js version 16.14 or above: When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

The authority managing OHTK-MS is responsible for configuring the system according to their local or community needs. There are several components to OHTK-MS that an authority may customize to best fit their jurisdiction. Governance Hierarchy First, the authority must create a Governance Hierarchy, which determines who can see what data depending on a particular user\u2019s province, state, or other country-specific regional grouping. This Governance Hierarchy will operate according to the area boundaries defined by the authority managing the system. In other words, OHTK-MS users will be able to create and view reports only in the areas they have access to. Depending on the configuration of the Governance Hierarchy, some users may be able to see multiple or even all areas if the authority is a regional agency. Report Types Next, the authority must create their Report Categories and Report Templates. The Report Categories determine which health threat OHTK-MS will be configured for. For example, if your authority is interested in a traditional One Health Approach, then you would enable Report Categories for animal, human, and environmental threats. Creating Report Templates allows you to create reusable customized forms for specific health threats that your authority or community are interested in. These Report Templates can be configured to collect structured and unstructured data according to the type of report and the state of the case (such as when a Case is escalated to an Outbreak). For example, if your authority is conducting larvae counting for dengue fever surveillance, you would create a Report Template that allows users to upload photos of mosquito larvae living in various homes in the community and submit the reports to OHTK-MS. Dashboards and Reporting The One Health Risk Management Dashboard displays a real-time view of new and on-going Reports, Cases, and Outbreaks. Users can drill-down into specific Reports, collaborate with other users on Cases, view and export data for further analysis. The Dashboard also provides a real-time map of health events according to a user\u2019s authority. The data displayed in the Dashboard depends on the Governance Hierarchy of the user and their permission to interact with the Dashboard depends on their user\u2019s Role. For example, a Department of Livestock official who might be interested in Avian Influenza, can monitor incoming reports for suspicious illness in chicken, and keep track of on-going investigations for preliminary Cases of the bird flu. While OHTK-MS will automatically escalate Reports to Cases if they meet predefined Case Definitions, the official may judge a Report to be suspicious enough to warrant manually escalating to Case. Likewise, if the investigation confirms an Avian Influenza infection, then the official might escalate the Case to an Outbreak status and OHTK-MS will automatically trigger notifications to the local agencies responsible for animal outbreaks.","title":"ohtk-ms"},{"location":"ohtk-ms/#ohtk-ms","text":"The OHTK Management System allows local authorities to track incoming reports, manage cases, and respond to outbreaks.","title":"OHTK MS"},{"location":"ohtk-ms/#setting-up-ohtk-ms","text":"","title":"Setting up OHTK-MS"},{"location":"ohtk-ms/#what-youll-need","text":"Node.js version 16.14 or above: When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

Rather than relying on traditional surveillance methods using trained epidemiologists in the field, the Toolkit Software can be used by non-technical users for a variety of public health concerns. The Toolkit provides a Surveillance Management System ( ohtk-ms ) for local authorities and a Reporter App ( ohtk-mobile ) for trained reporters or volunteers. Local Governments or similar local authorities use OHTK-MS and OHTK-Mobile together to create a complete surveillance system used for managing and responding to emerging One Health threats. The API ( ohtk-api ) connects the mobile app and the management system together. Reports, Cases, and Outbreaks In traditional surveillance, when a community health event is reported each regional department must be notified until the report reaches the national agencies, and then the response must be coordinated top-down until it at last reaches the local community. In the Toolkit, the time to confirm an outbreak and respond is significantly faster than traditional surveillance, because the specific person or agency who is responsible for the specific type of health threat is notified, and they have jurisdiction in the region where the report originated. Important notifications are configured based on the region of the authority, and the type of health threat. For example, if there are several sick cows reported with similar characteristics in a related area, then typically the Department of Livestock Development for that region is notified. Conversely, if there is a rise in Influenza-like-illness among members of a community then the local Department of Disease Control might be alerted of a possible outbreak. These notifications can be SMS messages, emails, or push notifications in the Reporter App. Authorities using the Toolkit Software must decide how their community defines a \u201cCase\u201d and an \u201cOutbreak\u201d. Case Definition is how your authority defines whether a Report is worth investigating. When Reports are escalated to Cases, their lifecycle is tracked in OHTK-MS from creation to resolution \u2013 even if the Case is a false alarm. The Case and Outbreak workflow can be granularly defined according to each authority\u2019s current or future contingency planning. When a report is submitted to the system, if it matches predefined characteristics, such more than 5 dead cows in a related area, then the system will automatically convert the report into a Case, and it will be escalated to the individuals or groups that are responsible for that area according to the Governance Hierarchy. However if the Case is confirmed as an Outbreak, then the system can further notify additional agencies to respond accordingly to contain the spread. For example, if a public health officer is notified of a suspicious Case, and after investigation lab tests confirm a foot & mouth diagnosis, this officer can use the system to update the status of the Case to an Outbreak, which can trigger notifications to wider officers and agencies depending on the local authority\u2019s configuration.
