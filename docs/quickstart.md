#### Overview
The One Health Toolkit Software is technology which enables you to deploy One Health surveillance in any context with the right amount of community engagement and local leadership. Rather than relying on traditional surveillance methods using trained epidemiologists in the field, the Toolkit Software can be used by non-technical users for a variety of public health concerns. 

The Toolkit provides a **Surveillance Management System** ([ohtk-ms](/ohtk-docs/ohtk-ms)) for local authorities and a **Reporter App** ([ohtk-mobile](/ohtk-docs/ohtk-mobile)) for trained reporters or volunteers. Local Governments or similar local authorities use OHTK-MS and OHTK-Mobile together to create a complete surveillance system used for managing and responding to emerging One Health threats. The **API** ([ohtk-api](/ohtk-docs/ohtk-api)) connects the mobile app and the management system together. 

#### The One Health Surveillance Management System

OHTK-MS is deployed by local authorities in order to track incoming reports from their community volunteers, manage high risk cases, and respond to potential outbreaks. The authority managing OHTK-MS is responsible for configuring the system according to their local or community needs. There are several components to OHTK-MS that an authority may customize to best fit their jurisdiction.
